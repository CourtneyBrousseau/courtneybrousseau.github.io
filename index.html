                    <h3>Chair, <a href="http://studentunion.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">ASUC Student Union</a> Board of Directors</h3>
                    <p>I was appointed as one of four undergraduates on the board, representing 25,000+ undergraduates. The board oversees the non-profit management of dining options, the official Student Store, two campus buildings, an Art Studio, as well as campus Event Services. As chair, I oversaw the Student Union's transition from a major dining vendor to a group of smaller vendors, created systems for better board transparency and efficiency, managed the complex annual ~$10 million budget process, and navigated conflicts related to student government autonomy, space allocation, and changes to the campus organizational chart.</p>

                    <h3>Head of Special Projects and Product Manager, <a href="https://asuc.org/berkeley-mobile/" target="_blank">Berkeley Mobile</a></h3>

                    <p>Berkeley Mobile is a mobile application that helps students access campus resources like bus schedules and dining hall menus. As product manager, I worked with an amazing team of engineers/designers to maintain & upgrade the app, which has 20,000+ downloads and ~2,000 average monthly users on iOS & Android. I implemented the first-ever user testing of the app to assess user needs, launched a complete redesign of the application, led the team through 3 agile sprints, and spearheaded an open source initiative. I wrote a (lengthy) <a href="https://medium.com/@cbrewsayso/reflecting-on-my-year-as-product-manager-of-berkeley-mobile-db621f0131a8" target="_blank">Medium post</a> about my experiences as PM. After serving as product manager, I led special projects that I wanted to work on as PM but never got a chance to, including continuous integration/deployment, A/B tests, and better defining/measuring our impact.</p>

I looked at support and response rates among different demographic groups (political party, age, county, and more) and created geojson maps to show relative support and response rates geographically. I also made recommendations to the campaign team for improving the search engine optimization (SEO) of <a href="https://www.eleniforca.com" target="_blank">eleniforca.com.</a></p>

                    <h2>What I've Failed At</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Quick note: All too often, especially at places like Berkeley, people highlight their successes and hide their failures. I believe this contributes to impostor syndrome and a toxic culture of one-upmanship. I personally have failed many times at many things. I hope by sharing some of my failures here, I can help change the perception about failure both for myself and others.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>Code for Berkeley</a></h3>
                    <p>During my junior year, I attempted to start a <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Code for America</a> brigade (volunteer chapter) on Berkeley's campus. I made a number of mistakes that set the club up for failure and caused me to decide to shut it down after the first year. The biggest mistakes I have identified are: (1) despite my best efforts, I often micromanaged other club members which is a tendency I know I am prone to and am working on correcting (2) I didn't do enough to create a shared vision amongst the leadership team about what we were doing and why before getting started on bigger projects (3) I was simultaneously the Product Manager of Berkeley Mobile and the Chair of the ASUC Student Union Board which, along with school and some other commitments, was already way too much to handle.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h3>The Berkeley Forum Podcast</a></h3>
                    <p>When I was Head of Special Projects for the Berkeley Forum, I worked on creating The Berkeley Forum Podcast. The podcast was meant to help us engage people outside of Berkeley as well as ensure that recordings of our events were shared faster (our video editing backlog was massive and contributed to long delays in video recordings being posted). At the time, there were some concerns among my peers that the podcast would cease to exist after the creator/engineer/maintainer of the podcast graduated. I made some (but not enough) efforts to ensure that he was teaching others how to maintain the podcast through trainings and documentation. Ultimately, my failure to push harder for better trainings/documentation did result in the podcast being discontinued shortly after I left the Berkeley Forum despite its  promising download statistics.</p>
                    </br>

                    <h2>What I've Built</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Quick note: I enjoy working on side projects like these to learn new skills and pursue passion projects. That being said, I think that the idea that full-time developers need to do side projects to be considered successful or truly passionate engineers is ridiculous (in the same way that requiring surgeons to perform surgery outside of work to be considered truly passionate about their job would be considered ridiculous).</p>
